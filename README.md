The rate of vaccination is a probability of an uninfected person to get vaccinated.

The rate of infection is the probability of an uninfected person to get infected, when in contact with an infected individual.

The rate of social distancing is the probability of a person choosing to stay isolated during the pandemic. (Note for social distancing to be enabled, you must launch the program by clicking social distancing on).

Right at the bottom there is a dropdown menu that will contain two options â€“ Graph active cases or total cases which will do exactly as mentioned. (Please note that the total cases have been scaled down by a factor of 150 as otherwise it would overlap with the simulation space or shoot out of your screen.)

To launch the simulation, select any of the two buttons. To launch it once again, close the window and reopen the application.
